---
--- A Language Server Protocol implementation for Ruff, an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust. It can be installed via `pip`.
---
--- ```sh
--- pip install ruff
--- ```
---
--- **Available in Ruff `v0.4.5` in beta and stabilized in Ruff `v0.5.3`.**
---
--- This is the new built-in language server written in Rust. It supports the same feature set as `ruff-lsp`, but with superior performance and no installation required. Note that the `ruff-lsp` server will continue to be maintained until further notice.
---
--- Server settings can be provided via:
---
--- ```lua
--- vim.lsp.config('ruff', {
---   init_options = {
---     settings = {
---       -- Server settings should go here
---     }
---   }
--- })
--- ```
---
--- Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/) for more details.

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("LspAttach", {
	group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("lsp_attach_disable_ruff_hover", { clear = true }),
	callback = function(args)
		local client = vim.lsp.get_client_by_id(args.data.client_id)
		if client == nil then
			return
		end
		if client.name == "ruff" then
			-- Disable hover in favor of Pyright
			client.server_capabilities.hoverProvider = false
		end
	end,
	desc = "LSP: Disable hover capability from Ruff",
})
