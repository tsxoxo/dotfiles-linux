### KEYS
#
# I tried this but TAB gave me weird behavior: sometimes inishing completion
# prematurely and inserting a space and moving to the next arg.
# these are bound by default to C-n and C-p which seem like good choices
# TAB: menu-complete
# "\e[Z": menu-complete-backward # Shift-Tab

"\e ": magic-space # alt+Space
# "\C-" history-expand-line

# Up and Down arrows move through history
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward

# Ctrl+r, Ctrl-r
"\C-r": reverse-search-history
"\C-f": forward-search-history

# "\C-x\C-x": edit-and-execute-command # already bound to 'v' in vi-command mode by default

# completion
